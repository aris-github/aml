Eclipse EMF models and tree structures for AutomationML

## CAEX215, CAEX215.impl, CAEX215.util

These packages contain EMF code for CAEX 2.15 XML schema.
* An Eclipse Ecore model of the 2.15 XML schema     
    * It is possible to have Eclipse generate these models (the Ecore model and genmodel) from the XSD file; however, one must remove the "Revision" from the "Header" group to avoid circular definitions (Eclipse does not like those).
    * One can then add the "Revision" part manually again (to CAEXBasicObject) using the Eclipse Ecore editor. This is how the current Ecore model was created.
    * The current Ecore model also contains some modifications concerning AnyType objects - EMF does not handle these well by default, and so every object in the XSD of type "anyType" must be manually added and its type be set to "AnyType" (see for example "Additional Information" in the Ecore model).
* A Java implementation of the Ecore model (generated by EMF, extended by hand)
* An XML Parser for parsing AutomationML files
* An AML Importer for converting the parsed AML into Java objects w.r.t. the Ecore model
* A Protege plugin to expose the AML Importer interface to Protege

## concept.model

This package contains the implementation of `AML Concept Attributes` and `AML Concept Model`.

These are classes for representing ontological semantics in AML models.

## concept.tree

This package contains the implementation of generic tree data structures
